title: "Modern geometry for the nathematically curious"
---

My thought is to try and explain some foundations on types of mathematical objects that are studied in modern research.

I am a PhD student in mathematics focused on an area called differential geometry. If you do not know what that is, you soon will.


When most people hear geometry, they are taken back to a classroom filled with unenthusiastic classmates where that monotone sounding teacher mumbles something on triangles and the Pythagoras theorem. 

Start with a set

build up to manifold
